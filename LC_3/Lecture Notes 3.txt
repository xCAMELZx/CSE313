Von-Neumann Model -- Chapter 4 

	 To get any task done by the computer we need 2 things. 
		1. We need a computer program. Specifies the task the needs to be performed. 
		2. Computer to carry out the task. 
		
Von-Neumann Fundamental Model: Processing Computer Programs -- 1946 
	1. Memory - Contains instructions and data. 
	2. CPU, Processing Unit - Performing arithmetic and logic operations. 
	3. Input Device, I/O - Keyboard, Mouse, Scanners, Disks, 
	4. Output Device - Monitor, Printer, LED, Disks. 
	5. Control Unit - Interpreting Instructions. 
	
	Von-Neumann Model: 
										Memory (MAR, MDR) 
								
			            Input (keyboard, mouse)         Output (Monitor, Printer) 
										
										       CPU (ALU, TEMP)
		
									       Control Unit (PC, IR) 
										   
										   
1. Memory: 
2^k(xm) array of stored bit 
Address Space: 2^k 
Addressability: m bits 

Ex: 256 MB 
Address Space: 256 Million 
Addressability: 1 Byte( 8 bits ) 

Basic Operations of Memory: 

LOAD: Read a value from a memory location. 
STORE: Write a value into a memory location. 

MAR - Memory Address Register 
MDR - Memory Data Register 

Interfacing to Memory: 
	How does processing unit get data to/from a memory location? 

			To LOAD a location (A) 
				1. Writes the address (A) into MAR 
				2. Signal "Read" will be enabled. 
				3. Reads the "Data" from MDR. 
			
			To STORE a value x into location (A) 
				1. Write data (x) into MDR. 
				2. Write address (A) into MAR
				3. "Write" signal enabled. 
				
				
2. Processing Unit: 
	The actual processing of information in the computer; is carried out 
	by the processing unit. 
	
	Consists Of: 
		(1): ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit - Add, Subtract, AND, OR, NOT
					Other complex functional units: divide, square root. 
					* LC-3: Performs some arithmetic operations: ADD, AND, NOT. 
		
		(2) Registers 
				- Small, temporary storage. 
				- Operands and results of functional units. 
				* LC-3: 8 General Purpose Registers. 
						R0, R1, R2, .... R7 
							each register holds 16 bits 
		(3) Word Size 
				- Number of bits normally processed by ALU in one instructions 
				- Width of the registers. 
				*LC-3: 16-Bits.
				
				
3. Input and Output: 
	*LC-3 => Input is Keyboard 
			Output => Monitor 
				
4. Control Unit: 
	Orchestrates the execution of the program. 
	To keep track of which instructions is being executed, control unit has the instruction register
	(IR) = Contains the current instructions 
	
To keep track of which instructions needs to be executed next => The CU has a register that contains the next instruction address. 
			This is known as the Program Counter Register (PC) 
			
			(PC) = Contains the address that needs to be executed. 
			
							Instruction Processing:
			* The control idea of Von-Neumann model is that instructions & Data are both stored in sequence of bits in computer memory. 
				The program is executed (one instruction at a time). 

				
			Instruction: Specifies 2 things: 
			 1. Opcode - opearation to be performed 
			 2. Operands - data/location to be used for operation 
			 
			 Add Instruction: ADD, ___, ___, ____ 
			 3 Operands  - 2 Source Commands (data to be added 
						 - 1 Destination operand (result of sum) 
						
				Example: LC-3 ADD Instruction: 
					LC-3 => Has 16 bit instruction (2^4) 
						=> each instruction has 4 bit code [15:12] 
								LC-3 has 8 GPR's => R0, R1, R2, .... R7
